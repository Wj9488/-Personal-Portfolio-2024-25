      I led a class of 26 students through an 8-week Python bootcamp at Excode, 
      the largest student-led bootcamp in the country run entirely by volunteers. 
      My primary responsibility was to ensure students grasped the basics of Python 
      by applying the language to various in-class exercises. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Throughout this experience, 
      I significantly strengthened my understanding of Python, honed my teaching skills in 
      both one-on-one and classroom settings, and enhanced my proficiency with tools such 
      as Outlook Mail and Google Colab.
