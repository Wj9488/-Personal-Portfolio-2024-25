      Developed custom front ends using Next.js 13, 
      Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS for a small magazine business aiming to 
      diversify its product offering and modernise its brand. 
      <br />
      <br />
      I was responsible 
      for designing and developing a custom website and newsletter template. 
      This experience significantly strengthened my understanding of Next.js and 
      Sanity CMS, improved my proficiency with Figma, and provided me with a valuable 
      glimpse into the workings of a highly specialised agency. Furthermore, I 
      gained a deeper understanding of modern agency workflows, including the use of GitHub.
