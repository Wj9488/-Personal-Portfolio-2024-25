      During my internship, I contributed to the development of a fully custom
       website with a WordPress backend
       for Birdlime Media UK, a podcast and video production company.

       <br />
       This 
       project allowed me to develop a strong understanding of WordPress 
       as a CMS backend, gain a basic knowledge of PHP programming, and 
       enhance my proficiency in SASS (CSS). Additionally, I acquired valuable 
       insights into the operations of a boutique web design agency, from client 
       onboarding to project delivery.
